Step-by-step onboarding and best-practice guide for using Claude Cowork on the Pro plan, focused on legal workflows and the Legal plugin, including governance, guardrails, and practical, low-risk pilot use cases.

***

## Phase 1 – Environment & Pro Plan Setup (1–10)

1. Confirm your Mac meets Claude Cowork’s requirements (recent macOS, adequate RAM/disk, stable internet).

2. Decide to start on **Claude Pro** (20 USD/month); this includes Cowork but with significantly lower usage than Max.

62. Configure Legal plugin instructions so Cowork saves its outputs (issue lists, risk matrices, proposed edits, draft summaries) into a “Legal-Cowork/drafts” folder with your standardized naming.

63. Draft a short “LEGAL_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md” explaining when and how to use /review-contract, /triage-nda, /legal:compliance-check, /legal:risk-assessment, and /legal:brief, plus where outputs live and how they feed into your review process.

64. Pilot /review-contract on non‑critical or sanitized contracts, keeping each run **narrowly scoped** (e.g., “Review only liability and indemnity sections for red flags and summarize in ≤20 bullet points”) to control Pro usage.

65. Compare Cowork’s flags and suggestions against your own; update SKILL.md with concrete examples of acceptable vs. unacceptable language and any recurring misjudgments.

66. Build an NDA workflow around /triage-nda: define categories (auto‑approve, paralegal review, counsel review) and rules for each, targeting low‑risk, high‑volume NDAs as your first production use case.

67. Use /legal:compliance-check to encode checklists for frameworks like GDPR DPAs or sector‑specific regulations, then validate Cowork’s outputs against your existing templates and regulatory matrices.

68. Where available, integrate Enterprise Search so Legal commands (e.g., /legal:brief, /legal:risk-assessment) can pull from your prior matters, internal policies, and playbooks, reducing repetition and improving consistency.

69. Maintain an audit trail for Cowork‑assisted legal work: keep the input document, Cowork’s raw output, your final approved version, and a short note on what you changed and why.

70. Expand Cowork’s role beyond low‑risk use cases only after repeated pilots show alignment with your standards under this Pro‑tier, human‑in‑the‑loop model; if you find yourself constrained by limits on routine matters, reassess whether upgrading to Max is warranted.
